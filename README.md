_I'm all about it_

This project defines the Boolean Algebra Solver Service.

It's a prototype.

It's a proof of concept.

It's a cool toy.

It's a neat problem.


It's not production ready.

Running the Driver
------------------

`./gradlew run`

This will run `com.stanson.bass.BassDriver` - a program intended to exercise the solver in an
interactive way.

Building
--------

`./gradlew build`

Generates artifacts and runs tests.

Tests
------

`./gradlew test`

See the test cases for an idea of what I'm working on. These are standard Spock tests.
